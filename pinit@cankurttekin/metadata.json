Click on tray icon, it will show up a dialog where you can input your notification title, message and optionally icon(default will be same as the extension icon). Important: Do not put any information that you would care if lost. Due to the limitation on the GNOME Shell, only the 3 most recent notifications are shown by per app, so notifications can disappear before you have a chance to act on them(blogs.gnome.org). Please report bugs to github page below.",
